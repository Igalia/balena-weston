  Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, as well as an
  useful environment in and of itself.

  Out of the box, Weston provides a very basic desktop, or a full-featured
  environment for non-desktop uses such as automotive, embedded, in-flight,
  industrial, kiosks, set-top boxes and TVs. It also provides a library allowing
  other projects to build their own full-featured environments on top of
  Weston's core.

  The core focus of Weston is correctness and reliability. Weston aims to be
  lean and fast, but more importantly, to be predictable. Whilst Weston does
  have known bugs and shortcomings, we avoid unknown or variable behaviour as
  much as possible, including variable performance such as occasional spikes in
  frame display time.
